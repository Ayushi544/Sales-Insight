# Sales-Insight
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights that can help improve sales performance.

The goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard using SQL to analyse sales data and provide insights to help improve sales performance. The dataset contains information on sales transactions, customer demographics, product details, and market details.
The project will involve the following steps:
1.	Data extraction: The first step is to extract the data from the source system using SQL. The data will be extracted from various tables, such as sales transactions, customer information, product details, and sales performance metrics.
2.	Data transformation: Once the data has been extracted, it will be transformed to make it suitable for analysis. This will involve cleaning the data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating calculated columns.
3.	Data modelling: After the data has been transformed, it will be modelled using SQL to create a star schema that will serve as the basis for the Power BI dashboard. The star schema will have a fact table containing sales transactions and several dimension tables, such as customer, product, and time.
4.	Dashboard creation: The next step is to create a Power BI dashboard using the modelled data. The dashboard will contain various visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and tables, that will provide insights into sales performance. The dashboard will be designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into the data to gain deeper insights.
5.	Deployment: The final step is to deploy the dashboard to the relevant stakeholders. This can be done by publishing the dashboard to a web portal or by embedding it into an existing application.
